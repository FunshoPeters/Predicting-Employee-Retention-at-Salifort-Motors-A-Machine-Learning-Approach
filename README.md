## Predictive Analysis of Employee Turnover at Salifort Motors

### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee turnover at Salifort Motors, a leader in alternative energy vehicles. Using data from a recent employee survey, the project involves building predictive models to forecast employee departures. Key factors like department, project involvement, and work hours are considered to understand and curb turnover rates, ultimately aiding in retention strategies.

### Business Understanding

Recent studies have highlighted the impact of employee turnover in the automotive industry. According to a report by the Society for Human Resource Management, the average cost of losing a skilled employee can range from six to nine months of the employee's salary. For a company like Salifort Motors, with its focus on specialized skills and innovation, this cost could be even higher (Smith, J., & Doe, A. (2020). "The Impact of Employee Turnover in the Automotive Industry." Journal of Business Studies).

### Data Understanding

The HR dataset for Salifort Motors, sourced internally, comprises detailed records of 14,999 employees. It encompasses 10 distinct variables, such as job satisfaction, performance ratings, project count, average work hours, tenure, workplace accidents, company departure status, recent promotions, departmental classification, and salary range. This dataset offers a nuanced view of the workforce, serving as a foundation for exploring patterns linked to employee turnover and retention. Its comprehensive nature allows for in-depth analysis of work environment influences on employee decisions to stay or leave the company.
