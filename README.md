## Predicting Employee Retention at Salifort Motors: A Machine Learning Approach

### Project Overview

This project aims to address the high turnover rate at Salifort Motors, a leading alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Leveraging a dataset from a recent employee survey, the project focuses on predicting the likelihood of employee departure using machine learning techniques. Factors such as job title, department, number of projects, and average monthly hours are analyzed to understand their impact on employee retention. The goal is to build a robust model, choosing from logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, or XGBoost, to accurately predict potential turnover. This analysis will aid the company in formulating strategies to improve employee satisfaction and retention, ultimately reducing the costs associated with high turnover. The project encapsulates data analysis, model building, and actionable recommendations for Salifort Motors to enhance its corporate culture and employee engagement.
